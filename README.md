## Dependencies
To run this project, you need to run the `Authorization Server` on port 8080 defined in the properties file `application.yaml`.

You will also need an authorized client on the server DB; the following INSERT will create the credentials needed:
```
INSERT INTO AUTH_SERVICE.client (clientId, authorizedGrantTypes, autoApproveScopes, redirectUri, scopes, secret) VALUES ('springBootAngular', 'authorization_code', '', 'http://localhost:8081/login', 'read,write', '$2a$10$jbIi/RIYNm5xAW9M7IaE5.WPw6BZgD8wcpkZUg0jm8RHPtdfDcMgm');
```

## Configuration
All configuration is done using properties; Spring Security will reach out the server and perform OAuth authentication and authorization.

JWT generated by the authorization server is validated using a public key.
> **NOTE:** If you generated your oun Java Key Store on the server, you must replace this public key by yours in the properties file.

## Installing
Just clone or download the repo and import it as an existing maven project.

Project can be run as java application from project root directory:
```
mvn clean install
java -jar target/authserver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
The command will build front end and store it inside `src/main/resources/static`
; go to README inside `front` folder for more information on the Angular project.

Angular front end will be available to access under http://localhost:8081/ and will automatically redirect you to
the login page on the authorization server.
